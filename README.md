### Abstract
Dengue risk mapping is essential for estimating disease burden, and informing targeted surveillance and control efforts. Current approaches to risk mapping vary widely in their methodology, data sources, output metrics and applications. Many existing approaches focus on predicting ecological suitability and produce high-resolution risk maps based on environmental conditions, yet high-resolution incidence maps remain scarce, leaving a critical gap in guiding precise, location-specific interventions. The prediction of disease incidence or transmission intensity remains relatively uncommon in disease ecology, largely due to data limitations, reporting biases, and the inherent complexity that arises from transmission dynamics. In this study, we applied disaggregation regression modelling to downscale aggregated dengue case data from 14 countries in Central and South America, generating fine-resolution incidence estimates that we subsequently projected onto the African continent. We then compared the resulting predictions from the incidence-based risk map with three widely used approaches: vector suitability index, dengue environmental suitability index, and mechanistic transmission potential (Index P). The disaggregation model achieved relatively strong predictive accuracy within the training region (mean correlation = 0.72) and showed partial alignment with reported burden across Africa (Spearman ρ = 0.33). Other risk maps exhibited similar or weaker correlations with reported cases in Africa, including ρ = 0.33 for dengue environmental suitability, ρ = 0.32 for transmission potential and ρ = 0.23 for Aedes aegypti suitability. Disaggregation regression offers a valuable tool for translating reported case data into spatially explicit estimates of burden, bridging the gap between ecological risk and epidemiological relevance. While spatial agreement was high in parts of coastal West Africa across the different risk map approaches, notable divergences highlight the distinct assumptions underlying each framework.
